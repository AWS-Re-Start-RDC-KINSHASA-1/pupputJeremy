  <ol> <li><p><h4><b>context:</b></h4></li> You have a server in which you want to install Apache, flask, git, cl√¥ne your project from github and create a configuration file which will regulate the operation of your instance. It's simple using a few Linux commands you can install and start your applications and set up your configuration. But imagine you have 1000 servers, how do you install all these applications and make sure they are still running? this is why in this tutorial we introduce you to the Puppet tool which is a configuration manager and allows you to automate tasks in the configuration of your servers</p>

  <h4>
    <b>How does puppet work ?</b>
    </h4>
    <p>Puppet is based on a master-slave communication system. There is therefore a Master server and one or more slave servers linked to it. The master contains a module which in turn contains a manifest, a template and static files which can be downloaded by the slave servers  and the slaves servers contain each an agent and a factor.</p>
    <p>The Slave servers sends a SSL certificate t the master to ask for a secure connection, the master responds by sinning the certificate, once the slave server (client node) is aware that the master has signed the certificate his factor analyses it's current state (configurations and installed software informations) and these informations will be sent the master as facts and any of thoses facts will be compared to the desired state specified in Puppet manifests on the Puppet Master server. If there is a difference between them the missing elements will be installed, created or started</p>
